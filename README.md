  A curious Full Stack Developer from India, building tech with purpose and growing one project at a time.

### 🧑‍💻 About Me:
I'm a developer who enjoys combining logic and creativity to build practical and user-friendly applications.  
While I’ve spent a lot of time learning **C++**, and exploring **Data Structures & Algorithms**, I approach problem-solving with a calm and steady mindset — always open to learning more, not rushing it.

Right now, I’m focusing on:

- 🧠 Sharpening my understanding of **DSA** through consistent practice  
- 💻 Exploring the full stack: **Next.js, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS**  
- 📦 Building real-world applications that solve real problems

I believe in clean code, continuous learning, and meaningful collaboration.
